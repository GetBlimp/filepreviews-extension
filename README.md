# filepreviews-extension
This is an experimental extension using the [FilePreviews.io](http://filepreviews.io) API to simplify the process of previewing files on the web. The main benefit of this extension is that it will provide the user with an image preview of almost any kind of file.

#### This is a work in progress.

### Usage
To use the extension just right click on an image or link and select FilePreviews from the context menu. That action will open a window which will eventually show the preview image generated by the service.

### Try it
[FilePreviews.io](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/filepreviewsio/ehikoklcpeebdjcndeolpgoomjggmgoi) on the Google Web Store
